An easy way to share designs with clients and colleagues for feedback and review.

== Description ==

[Design Feedback](http://designfeedbackplugin.com/) allows you to easily share any design (mockups, wireframes, sitemaps) without the complexity of email attachments or third-party services.  Clients and colleagues view your work in their browser and post feedback directly on your designs. 

* **Simple Sharing** - Send links (not attachments) to any design you can think of. Share logos, sitemaps, wireframes, mockups, stock photography, and more.

* **Better Feedback** - Since clients view designs in their browser, they can leave feedback directly on the designs as if they were completely developed.

* **Happy Clients** - Delight your clients with easy to open designs and a simple feedback process.  No more missing files, back and forth emails, miscommunication or lost feedback.
