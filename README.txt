An easy way to share designs with clients and colleagues for feedback and review.

== Description ==

**New Feature in v1.1** Now you can **password protect** your designs for client privacy. 

[Cycles](http://getCycles.io/) allows you to easily share any design (mockups, wireframes, sitemaps) without the complexity of email attachments or third-party services.  Clients and colleagues view your work in their browser and post feedback directly on your designs.  

* **Simple, Secure Sharing** - Send links (not attachments) to any design you can think of. Share logos, sitemaps, wireframes, mockups, stock photography, and more.  Password protect your designs to protect client privacy.

* **Better Feedback** - Since clients view designs in their browser, they can leave feedback directly on the designs as if they were completely developed.

* **Happy Clients** - Delight your clients with easy to open designs and a simple feedback process.  No more missing files, back and forth emails, miscommunication or lost feedback.

**How do I get started?**

Once you've installed the plugin, sharing designs with clients is easy.  Go to 'Cycles' in the sidebar, and click add new (`Cycles > Add New`).  Give your design a name (clients will see this) and add an image. You can optionally adjust the share URL to make it more client friendly.  Finally, click "save" and you're ready to share and receive feedback.

No! Your clients need only open your URL in a browser to begin leaving feedback.

Cycles works with most image types supported by WordPress, such as JPEG, GIF, PNG, and BMP.
